<h2>Martiros Saryan was an Armenian painter,the founder of a modern Armenian<br> national school of painting.<br><span>(Armenian: Մարտիրոս Սարյան)</span><br> <span>28 February 1880 – 5 May 1972 </span></h2>
<figure><p>He was born into an Armenian family in Nakhichevan-on-Don (now part of Rostov-on-Don, Russia). </p>
<p>In 1895 at the age of 15, he completed the Nakhichevan school and from 1897 to 1904 studied at the Moscow School of Arts, including in the workshops of Valentin Serov and Konstantin Korovin. He was heavily influenced by the work of Paul Gauguin and Henri Matisse. He exhibited his works in various shows. He had works shown at the Blue Rose Exhibit in Moscow.</p>
<p>He first visited Armenia, then part of the Russian Empire, in 1901, visiting Lori, Shirak, Echmiadzin, Haghpat, Sanahin, Yerevan and Sevan. He composed his first landscapes depicting Armenia.</p>
<p>From 1910 to 1913 he traveled extensively in Turkey, Egypt and Iran. In 1915, he went to Echmiadzin to help refugees who had fled from the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire. In 1916, he traveled to Tiflis (now Tbilisi) where he married Lusik Agayan. </p>
<p>Following the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, he went with his family to live in Russia. In 1921, they moved to Armenia. While most of his work reflected the Armenian landscape, he also designed the coat of arms for the Armenian SSR and designed the curtain for the first Armenian state theatre. </p>
<p>From 1926 to 1928 he lived and worked in Paris, but most works from this period were destroyed in a fire on board the boat on which he returned to the Soviet Union. From 1928 until his death, Saryan lived in Soviet Armenia.</p>
<p>Saryan died in Yerevan on 5 May 1972. His former home in Yerevan is now a museum dedicated to his work with hundreds of items on display. He was buried in Yerevan at the Pantheon next to Komitas Vardapet.</p></figure>
